A mix of my notes, reflections, and random cool stuff I come across.  
In short—whatever I feel like sharing.

Since English isn’t my first language, some sentences might sound a little off.  
If you spot anything wrong, feel free to reach out to me through the About page or the contact info in the footer.  

If you prefer reading in Taiwanese, check out the [中文版](/zh-tw).
